# DFrFT-Simulation
This is a MATLAB simulation for eigenvector decomposition-type DFrFT.

File Description:
matlab/Kernel.m outputs the N-point kernel matrix for DFrFT with angle alpha
matlab/frft_video.m creates a video showing the time-frequency distribution of the input signal after different angles of DFrFT
matlab/filtering.m filters the referencr signal by DFrFT
rotate.avi is the video created by frft_video.m
